An interesting project i started, may continue in the future. This is currently a stand alone "game" so to speak.

Written in C++, i learned a LARGe amount about interfacing with the windows layer and writing windows applications
from scratch. I also learned how to use interfaces, as well as some design patterns like seperating the windows layer
from the operating layer such that to convert the program to MAC or LINUX, one would only have to change that layer.

Currently, it opens a window with a gradient on the backround. You can control the white box via WASD keys or via controller.

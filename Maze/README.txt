A psuedo-random maze generator written in c++

the original idea was to use this to teach myself C++, since i have been too occupied
with school and other projects to work on it, but i did learn to use interfaces, algoriths,
and proper c++ syntax. currently, it only generates the start and end locations label by
S for start and E for end, both of which can only occur on edges.
